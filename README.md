## Time Complexity

<p>Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It measures the time taken to execute each statement of code in an algorithm. It is not going to examine the total execution time of an algorithm.</p><br></br>
 
| ### Techniques to calculate Time Complexity: |
|------------------------------------------|
| Once we are able to write the runtime in terms of the size of the input (n), we can find the time complexity. For example: |
